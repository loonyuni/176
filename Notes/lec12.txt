Querying Biological Networks pt 2
10/09/2014

Network alignment:
    input - protein networks of two organisms
                1. reference network (well studied)
                2. not so well studied network

    question - How to use well known modules fromwell studied organisms to find analogs

two ways:
    1. topology based search
        -covered last lecture (signalling pathways)
    2. take information from one organisms network, and project it onto another organisms network and identify homologous pathways 
    
    given a query graph $Q = (V_Q, E_Q)$ and a directed weighted graph G, find a sub network G' of G and a mapping from V_q to V_g' that maximizes the similarity of the matched nodes + penalty for insertions and deletions, and ther reliability of interactions in G'

    all on the slides 

    NP complete
    constrain the query graph to try and get lienar time 

    Simple path queries 
    Use dynamic programming - analogy betweeen network and sequence alignment 
    
    again - on slides 

    What about cycles?
        use color coding to evade this issue
        can't contain two nodes of the same color
        DP matrix now contains D(i,j,c) = maximal score of a partial solution that consists of query nodes {1..i} and ends at vertex j of G and visits each colors in C exactly once.
